# 1. RobotCraft Bot v2.0

![Ingeniarius Store](documentation/images/ingeniarius_logo.png)

[Ingeniarius Store](https://store.ingeniarius.pt/)

[RobotCraft Bot v2.0](https://store.ingeniarius.pt/)  is a limited edition of mobile robots constructed during the 2nd Robotics Craftsmanship International Academy ([RobotCraft 2017](https://youtu.be/8kowPQPkloY)).

This robot is based in the Hercules platform, benefiting from the same Arduino-compatible motor controller that can consistently support the current up to 15A and driving voltage in the range of 6V-20V. Nevertheless, this robot additional includes an Arduino Mega board so that the platform can be easily controlled using a PID controller and the 34 PPR encoders. The Arduino firmware (available as download) also allows to control 4 Smart RGB LEDs WS2812B and read measurements taken from 2 Devantech SRF02 ultrasonic range finder and 1 Sharp GP2Y0A21YK infrared proximity sensor.

# 2. Features

![ROS Kinetic](documentation/images/ros_logo.jpg)


A Raspberry Pi 3 for high-level control, with [Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-xenial-final-release/) installed do the honours by running the [ROS Kinetic Kame](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic) distribution (ROS with specific routines included) and interfacing with the Arduino  Mega 2560 for low-level control (firmware with PID controller included) board through [rosserial](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial). All necessary topics are available in the ROS side, making it easy to implement any AI algorithm at will â€“ teleoperation and some few other routines are already included in the high-level ROS layer (available as download).

![Ingeniarius Snap!](documentation/images/snap_logo.png)

You think this is not enough? Well, RobotCraft Bot is the very first robotic platform integrated in our [Snap!-based block programming](https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Snap!_(Programming_Language)) platform! The architecture combines ROS standard with the Snap! visual programming language, targeting students from primary to higher education. The interface runs directly on the browser, benefiting from the power of the internet to program the robot.

# 4. Get Started

## 4.1. How to configure wifi access

To configure the WiFi access and, therefore, allow you to easily develop your algorithms within the ROS environment running in the Raspberry Pi 3 (RPI3), you can adopt any of the following approaches: 1) use the RPI3 as CPU and connect the relevant peripherals, such as monitor, keyboard and mouse; 2) use the ethernet connection. 

Regardless of the approach, you will always need to use the following credentials:

***Default access credentials:***
**User:** pi 
**Pass:** raspberry


### 4.1.1. Local access with RPI3 as CPU

If you have a display with HDMI port available, probably this might be the easiest way to perform this initial configuration. Simply connect a monitor via HDMI, a keyboard and a mouse to the RPI3. Once the RPI3 is powered it will boot and display the Ubuntu Desktop. Go to the top right corner of the Desktop and scan for the desired wifi network and connect with the necessary credentials.

**Note:** Default RPI3 resolution 1280x800.

### 4.1.2. Local access by ethernet cable

You can connect your PC directly to the RPI3 using an ethernet cable. The RPI3 is configured with the static IP ***192.168.1.1*** defined and, therefore, you need to configure your ethernet connection with an IP within the same network (e.g., ***192.168.1.2*** ). 

You can install the software [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/), a free remote desktop aplication available for multi OS. After install NoMachine, simply open the aplication and add a new connection with the IP ***192.168.1.1***, and insert the default user and password previously presented. Finally, you will have access to the RPI3 Ubuntu Desktop. Now you can follow the exact same procedure as before, go to the top right corner of the Desktop, and scan for the desired wifi network.

**Note:** If the connection is unable to be established, please reboot your RPI3. 


## 4.2. Remote access by NoMachine

After configuring the wifi network (**Step 4.1.**), you should [download NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/), in case you did not followed ***Step 4.1.2***. After installing NoMachine, simple open the aplication, scan for available PC in your network, select the RPI3, and connect. Insert the default user and password previously presented. You will then have full access to the RPI3 Ubuntu Desktop.

![Ubuntu Mate Desktop](documentation/images/ubuntu_mate_desktop.png)

## 4.3. Remote access by SSH

You can access the robot by SSH but NoMachine will make your life easier. Nevertheless, if you still go for SSH, here are the steps to follow.

**If you are using a windows based OS in your PC:** 

First [download PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/), then choose the option SSH, input your RPI3 IP, and then simply make the connection and insert your user and password.


**If you are using a linux based OS in your PC:** 

First you should check your wifi IP, where your RPI3 is connected, by insert the follwing command in a terminal:
```
ifconfig
```
then run the following command:
```
ssh pi@RASPBETTYPI_IP
```
where *RASPBETTYPI_IP* is your RPI3 IP address, after the connection is succesfull accomplish it will be asked user and password.

# 6. ROS Integration (High-Level)

As previous refer in the [datasheet](documentation/robotcraft_bot_datasheet.pdf), the communication between the low-level (Arduino Mega [firmware](firmware/robot_firmware)) and RPI is accomplished by using rosserial (http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial).

If you are not familiarized with ROS, we advise you to explore first the framework by trying the following tuturials: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials


#### Robotcraft Bot Driver
To test this architecture, after you flash your Arduino Mega with firmware (already pre-installed in your robot), in the RPI3 side (ROS), open a terminal and run the following commands:

Launch robotcraft driver:
```
roslaunch robotcraft_bot driver.launch
```
Check all available topics by:
```
rostopic list
```

#### Robotcraft Bot Keyboard Teleoperation

Launch robotcraft driver +  Keyboard teleoperation node:
```
roslaunch robotcraft_bot teleop.launch
```
And the use you keyboard to control your robot. More info check [teleop_twist_keyboard](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard) ROS node.
